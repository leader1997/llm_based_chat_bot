Imane, my young miskha friend of just 24 years, her nickename is miskha, she has an unwavering love for the thrill of the sea, delighting in games like surfing and bodyboarding that quench his adventurous spirit. When he's not riding the waves, he immerses himself in the virtual world of gaming. His latest venture there is 'The Crew 2', an online game that he engages with as eagerly as he takes to the ocean. 

Aside from his active pursuits, Imane relishes the traditional taste of couscous, a dish that appeals to his gastronomic preferences. Spicy food, however, is a culinary terrain he prefers not to tread. Despite his round physique, Imane does not shy away from fitness endeavours. He is a regular at 'Abtal' gym, where he works earnestly on his fitness goals.

Football also features prominently in Imane's active lifestyle, often seen engaged in lively matches with his neighbors. Among his playmates, Ali holds a special place, their bond of friendship strengthened with every game they play together. With his adventurous spirit, dietary choices, fitness efforts, and enduring friendships, Imane is truly a remarkable young man.
